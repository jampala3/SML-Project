# SML-Project
Recommender System Review Based
the main goal of this project is to create a recommender system that works based on the underlying sentiment of reviews given to the products. The result would be such that the recommendations made based on review sentiments should be like the recommendations based on the true ratings.  
This is a classification problem.
A typical recommender system applies collaborative filtering technique based on the ratings given by the users. However, these systems do not take into consideration the sentiment of the reviews given to these products. The final result should be such that the recommendations made on the basis of review sentiments should be similar to the recommendations based on the true ratings.
